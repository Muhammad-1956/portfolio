    "DESCRIPTION": "Hello, my name is Mohamed Fouad, and I am from Egypt. I am 24 years old. I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, majoring in Medical Informatics, from Helwan University (2019–2023). Because of my love and passion for programming, I am highly enthusiastic about web development. I started learning web programming in 2022, beginning with HTML and CSS with extensive hands-on practice. I then moved on to JavaScript, where I enjoyed solving many problems and building interactive features. To become more professional, I studied Angular through Maximilian Schwarzmüller’s course. Throughout this journey, I have gained valuable knowledge and practical experience that enable me to develop modern, responsive user interfaces. I am also continuously learning and improving my skills."
